# Traffic_Monitoring_System

This project builds a scalable Traffic Route Monitoring and Visualization System using the TomTom API to retrieve real-time, traffic-aware routes. Data is stored in an AWS S3 data lake, while a Streamlit app with Folium maps enables interactive visualization for traffic analysis, logistics, and urban planning.
